The peaceful, three-mile march from North Tryon Street and J.W. Clay Boulevard to the Popp Martin Student Union was organized by students in response to the death of George Floyd, who died while he was handcuffed and forcibly restrained by officers from the Minneapolis Police Department on May 25. It is one of many demonstrations taking place in Charlotte and other cities nationwide since Floyd, who was black, died and the police officers involved were charged with his murder."
