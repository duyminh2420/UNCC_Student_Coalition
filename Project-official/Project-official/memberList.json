		"bio": "Austin Smith is an inspiring Computer Science and Japanese major that decided to start the UNCC Student Coalition to create a way for students to come together as a community and empowered their voices. “I just wanted to create a place where students can collectively organize and support their communities through various social movements such as racial, social, and climate justice. With the recent Covid-19 crisis it’s become apparent that students lack a proper voice as it pertains to the decision that UNCC makes, and I believe that we as students should have some input in what our school decides to do. Hopefully, the student coalition can empower students to have a greater voice in all aspects of their lives.”"
